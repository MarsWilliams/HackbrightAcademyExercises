I don't know
Where this world is going
For all this life is showing 
Breaks through
The paper chains that hold you
They hold me
You know I try and stay sober
But the feeling it's over
Life in this coma
It's hard to stay sober
In this life
Alone the struggle seems holy worthless
So find
Your friend
In defiance show we are no longer helpless

You made me forget myself
Until the moment I found I was something else
My heart is good
But believe me I could
Watch these heads
Go blow
I am alive I can barely feel fear
And I won't let go
Of this life I'm going to free myself
I don't want to know what your baby say
I will pull the trigger come judgement day
And I don't hear what your baby say
I'll bust this head for a funny game
I have no apology for these words
And understand that I can't escape
I have no more love for this world
If you hear me then let's break away
So people come on
The world that held you now has gone
Together the wolves will lay together alone the wolves will play

To the powers of old 
To the powers that be
You have fucked up this world but you won't fuck with me

In a state of enlightened anarchy each person will become his own ruler, they will conduct themselves in such a way that the behaviour will not hamper the well being of their neighbours. In an ideal state there will be no political institutions and therefore no political power.
