I done moved a lotta stones but I ain't an Egyptian
I made work disappear but I ain't a magician
I seen fiends lose weight offa crack nutrition
I get them checks on the first like a monthly subscription
They holla at me every day because they need their prescription
I'm like a male cheerleader: white girls are flippin'
Make Christians lose religions off the shit that I'm spittin'
I got families diminishin' offa what I'm distributin'
Finishin' the gimmicks with the shit I'm deliverin'
You're about to go fast like Thanksgivin' chit-er-lins
Don't end up a memory, niggas just rememberin'
Death anniversary, pourin' out some beer again
True Religion jeans with the laced up Timberlands
Bucket seats, bucket hat low like Gilligan
Hit your baby momma, left her panties on the ceilin' fan
Sent her to voicemail, but she gonna call again
Brown done came up and he won't fall again
Spittin for the hustlers cause the words are the empowerment
Smarter than those white boys in Ivy league colleges
But I used to move work to white boys in colleges

Most you rap niggas lyin' like a horoscope
Homie you homo like the Rocky Picture Horror Show
Seats in the Chevy same color as a kiwi skin
Voice of the hood, you rap niggas is CNN
28 grams on my Grandma's saucer
Heater on the waist, box cutter in the parka
Fiends at the door, Cold D up in lockup
Smokin' on ganja, sippin' java from Starbucks
Chillin' with chicken, roll gan out dey purses
Browntown served more niggas than churches
Die for your rhymes, then you wouldn't be worth shit
But to me it's real because I live my verses
No water in the house, underarm must
Puttin' water in the toilet just to make the fucker flush
I live too real for a movie
Smokin' gan same color as a coochie

Detroit. Streets. City. Broadcaster. Nigga

Ha!


You was raised off welfare, nursing on focused hope
Pops left, young age, mom got her shoulder rope
Mom can't do that, mom's drunk off dope
Cold water bath, tic tac sized soaps
Sis' got pregnant, when she was young
Out here trickin' making you watch her son
Stolen cable BET stay on the screen
Never a dull moment, mom fight with other fiends
The happiest moment when you sleep and you dream
Then you wake up to the same old thing
Cereal no milk, dishes in the sink
Older brother runnin' 'round, gettin' money, wearing mink
Won't buy nothin' to eat, always buy drinks
Get the whole house drunk, then shit pop off
Momma boyfriend trippin' 'bout a dime got lost
Mind is lost, smoke a blunt, try to do (law?)
Seem fit to sell drugs, but you just too soft
Hard times at school because your peer is off
Too many roaches, might see a mouse
Extension cords get power from the neighbor's house
Got two pair of jeans, dead air, one's
Brother old coke square smoke in your lungs
The man of the house but your momma youngest son
Back to the wall, face to the wind
Ma's scratch the last of the number but don't win
Sister disappearing always leaving her kids
Tired of ramen noodles, you can see your ribs
Lot of sugar in the Kool-Aid keep your thirst quenched
Cigarettes and weed, make your eyes squint
Fridge empty, nothin' in the cabinet but spinach
And you ain't Popeye, livin' in a crowded house
Space heater keeps you warm, while you sleep on the couch
Bridge card every first, keep food in your mouth
Unless your mom sell 'em for drugs, and then you know
That month, shit gon' be fucked up
So you go to school, for the free lunch and stuff
But niggas teasing like you some type of punk and stuff
So you got kicked out for punching and stuff
Headaches at night, and your stomach is growling
Crack smoke in the air and the wolves is howling
...eviction notice on the door
...niggas sleepin' on the floor
...you can't take it no more
Just listen you can make it out
Just look at what's around you take a different route
If you don't have a dream, how could it come true?
Take a look at me, look what I've been through
It's a discription...
Wish I could take you back to my younger days
Feet pajamas, oatmeal off the microwave
Way back when I used to watch cartoons
Now I just rock the same shit like cartoons
For the last buck with the chronic
I was supposed to be crib, fruit snacks and Sonic
Now I'm posted in the spot with sacks and Tonic
Serve the high school kids before home economics
With a mind full of money and a heart full of change
Gotcha nigga puffing loosies skip home, a thang
Don't take it as a diss if a nigga don't speak
It's just... a lot on my mind this week
Gave my nigga four years so I smoke more blunts
And the nigga that snitched got 36 months
... what goes around come back
Tryna make the beat cry put my life on the track
Sit in Champion hood, split a swisher down the middle
Nights in the snow, bloc high like acquittal
Got a get it, no matter what's the season
Missed my PO day gotta come up with a reason
My granny die, already used that fuck it
Let the dice know, sipping the henney straight back
Roll another sack gotta get my mind right
Hit the booth spit the truth like W. Cronkite
I'm a heavyweight, guns make you levitate
Bout to get the d back crackin' like '88
Phone was goin' on by Marvin
Cause niggas still hustlin' and starvin' Bitches in the kitchen, roaches in the cereal box
Front open but the screen don't lock
We just live everyday, we don't go no prob
Piss in the alleyway we ain't got no pot
The hook want us all, law harassing us daily
Pyrex pot still feed our babies
Crackhead moms sell dick for fixes
Forced to sell rocks, do two a rendition
Now a hundred, ninety-nine die in a million
Still hiding work in my grandma's ceiling
Old school stash in a crown royal bag
Thinking of the future cause the past is the past
Pain in my heart cause my daughter miss her dad
Wanna get my life straight, give her what I never had
Pain in my heart cause my daughter miss her dad
Wanna get my life straight, give her what I never had
Detroit desperado...
Rap Donald Goines in a red El Dorado
My lifestyle's fortune 500
When niggas just a crumb inside the world, where the bread run it
I'm 16 from the slums...
Street light reflect off the barrel of a gun
We expect death, lucky to reach puberty
Learned in the streets, public school wasn't teaching me
Graduate with honors as a cocaine scholar

Eat food... eat food
Eat food... eat food

[Verse 2:]
I sell nouns like pounds, verbs like birds
Clowns ain't heard, words I serve
Spit like Knicks, rhyme like dimes
Roll a dollar bill up snort these lines
Fresh off the curb on the quest for the bacons
Flipping occupation on the final destination
Daily operation currency chasing...
Got no patience (but what can I do?)
Daily operation currency chasing...
Got not patience for the pennies I ain't waiting
Pockets gettin' fatter, cause the purpose you progress
Without a harness on climb the ladder of success
Dan in the chest, brew in the belly
Liquor in the kidney counting money in the tele
My little nigga just came home
Locked up three years for robbing an autozone
Been out two days and he already heated
I'm chilling on the block with him, chilling getting weeded
He telling me about who he seen on the inside
Then we went to Cony, to get some chili cheese fries
Time passed, we was building 'bout the old days
Talking about the backstabbers robbing up the old jays
After that he ghost, I ain't see him
Heard he got locked robbing a lady in a BM
And just like that he's away from time
So I took time out to put his ass in a rhyme
Because...

[Hook: x2]
We see no evil, hear no evil
All we need now, is to speak no evil
Regardless of what, I'm gonna save my people
It all comes down to who?
See...

[Verse 2:]
Raise the window, swerve through the avenue
Pay homage to the spots I made revenue
Taking me my niggas ain't letting you
And they won't take another one, I'm betting you
God can strike me down if I'm a liar
For my nigga Los, died in a house fire
I ain't forgetting you, bring the whips through
Trapped up niggas, we got work to do
Shit jump off, we address 'em dawg
Got some grown ass niggas knocking at your door
They ain't selling shit, they just spitting clips
Ringing on your doorbell with them hollow tips
I ain't a violent nigga
But I can turn to one quick if you fuck with my niggas
Tryna live one life put a light to the swisher
Prolly smoke on the boat and get head on the river
I'm so ahead of my time
My pops ain't even bust his first nut yet
I'm a-whole-nother subject
Extra-curriculum, passion just to get more
Credit used synthetic, after this call the medic
Got a fetish for anything the color of lettuce
But they cut the horses' wings yeah, a Pegasus
Why you on some new con, new necklace
I transcend nijja a nigga dial right
Okay get your words up, hit Starbucks
Grab a bag of whole bean, whole food deli sandwiches
Blowing OG and I wrote this shit
And it goes like this a penny for your thoughts
But I plan to make millions
Or die cryin' in the end like the villain
Or sipping Teqo in outdoor pavilions
They keep telling me I'm brilliant
And I concur 'cause
My metaphors are better than yours
I broke obituary like brochure
And I'm trying to have mine like novel
Rap Dan Brown fight Angels and Demons
That's why I'm sipping on this bottle
I take your ho to Aeropostale and
She show me her body parts like Hostel...

Uh... nigga... I'm the nicest man... I don't give a fuck

It ain't trickin' if you got it
Yeah right it ain't trickin' if it's Jeep
If I can afford this you will absorb
My semen, dinners makin' copy cat peas
From mean mints, fiends leanin' throwing up
Will he demon? On the grind like strippers on zippers
To y'all young whippersnappers nigga I'm a blizzard
Nigga that's cold, I would do you so bold
If you ever disrespect this talent... uh
What the fuck you poppin' daughter-sect
Nigga I'm the architect
And my notepad's the blue print
Watch how I fuel shit
Getting away, watch these whorehats kill shit
This raps like Metal Gear Solid
Chrome stay polished
White spots like on Rasheed Wallace
Any nigga think they frolic
This is not a promise
Bust a nigga in the head like Vonage
I smoke chronic
Like a stressed rasta, you are not gangster
You are an impostor
Kick it like Henry
This is not sucka
Spit it so different Brown songs like opera
Fat lady singing, serenading you
Mask like the phantom mothafucka I will stab you
Ever seen a nigga with nothing to lose?
Desert Eagle cocked and it's aimed at you
Temper running short cause his daughter missing meals
Running low on options gotta get it with the steel
Niggas got pills, but we ain't Morpheus
Posted in the hood, 40 on the porch with us
Nigga what's good? What you don't know
Get your free tickets to tonight's murder show
If you want to come through holla at me
Get your VIP RSVP

[Verse 2]
This raps like Metal Gear Solid
Nigga I'm Snake
I detect "bitch-nigga" in your blood trait
Nigga you are dog-bait
Show you how a slug taste
Little cockroaches
Get hit with the bug spray
Sorta like Subway
Nigga losing weight
Front his ass to work
Now you asking where we stay
Give his ass the pump like 10 on 8
Now we leave with pieces like birthday cake
You are not straight
Nigga you are gay
My hair long like Rappin' 4-Tay
Your bitch want to braid it
Say she got skills
But she's just fishing
Want me to fill her gills
Nigga I'mma chill
I ain't really stuntin' you
Meat on her grill
Just like a barbecue
Better call a audible
Switch up your plays
That shit you running get you Blitz 2k
I throw bullets right in the flesh
If you intercept, you got got
Hit you with some shit that you ain't coming back from
Brown tight like 6 niggas in a Maxima
40 count I see 'em holding drunk calcium
Cause your bones ain't breaking we cracking 'em
White sheets wrapping 'em
It's over it's a wrap for 'em
A rap for 'em
I will throw you out the window, blaze up some indo
Cut on Ron Browz; Jumpin' Out The Window
The hook come for info. Ask 'em what they here for
Just tell 'em he was listening to Ron Browz
Bob your head. Nigga, don't fight it
I could take a shit in Autotune and you'll like it
Cause good times is far from what I had
Used to look at Thelma like "She ain't that bad"
So cop another bag, break a pill in half
And eat that motherfucker like a cow do grass
Rappers fallin' off. Careers dead and gone, but
"I stay on" [sample]
So live everyday like it's your last, dog
Cause dog, you never know when it's your time to go
So when the block's long, 'member it's a fast life
Up under street lights, hook flashing flash lights
Sittin' on the porch with a 5th of somethin'
Time to pour it up and make it sweeter than before
Tomorrow, we'll be sold, but still get it on, my nigga cause
"I stay on" [sample]

[Chorus: x2]
These niggas fallin' off. We got it for the low
Our block stay clickin', nigga. Yours move slow
You lookin' like you hurtin'. You smokin' on them clones, my nigga but
"I stay on" [sample]

I used to work at spots, make thirty off a hunnit'
I was fucked up at the time like "Run it"
So what, I sold dope. That don't make me who I is
Punked out a couple fights. That don't make me no bitch
Depths of the D. Straight-up out the cage
Danny Brown, motherfucker, out that Bruiser Brigade
Nigga on that no-look thunk shit
These Dunks don't match this fit, so unorthodox with it
If the bitches lookin' at me, cause they know I ain't basic
A blonde bitch could see that, no Lasik
Paint pictures. No need for the tracin'
"I stay on" [sample]
And I be in her walls. One time she almost fainted
Lived in a Slum Village, pussy a little tainted
So I strapped up before I went up in it
I ain't try'na catch nothin', buggin' while I'm up in it
Nigga... nigga... it's Detroit stand up... shit...
All the talk in the streets
Don't bother me none
I lay in bed don't miss a second of sleep
Blow a blunt pass out don't count no sheep
Wake up blow another one and still don't eat
Ice melting in the grand cru
Too high for rude comments
I look down on you
I'm humble and too nice
But I don't talk to no Nigga that can't look me in my eyes
Smoke a newport and take a shit
And text your bitch
She know she really want it
I'm just trying to crash the boards like udonis
Blow some chronic now she all up on it
Used to catch the bus to Great Lakes
To many hoes on me man dog I know they fake
Cause where were your hoes at
When I was tapping hoes and they couldn't even look back
I rather just kickback
And fuck with wifey
Rock heels she don't fuck with nikes
She say papi put it all inside me
And I don't do shit lay back and let her ride me

[Hook:]
Look how it all can change
Things change start getting some change
Same friends used to ask for change
A straight change cause they say you changed
And now look how it all can change
It feels strange when they say you changed
But think about it man you changed your life
Changed your car
Changed your crib
Changed your wife

How the fuck can I act funny
Far as I know I ain't never been bummy
And these bitches can't change me
Baby momma shot a mood
So I treat 'em al the same
I don't share things got my own lane
Niggas in he hood call me by my government name
Respected in the D used to hustle on 12th street
And I'm from Linwood
So you know I'm soul good
Should have been God merc
But I'm fighting in the D like Emanuel Steward
Niggas see you and won't say two words
But when your ass die they want to say a few words
And my real niggas I'll take a case for
Cock back drop back I'll take a face full
Niggas fake ain't no pride no more
Wonder why these real niggas won't ride no more

[Hook:]
Look how it all can change
Things change start getting some change
Same friends used to ask for change
A straight change cause they say you changed
Look how it all can change
It feels strange when they say you changed
But think about it man you changed in life
Changed your car
Changed your crib
Changed your wife
Roaches crawlin' up the wall, piss-stained beds
Niggas dreamin' 'bout piff, but we rolling up reg
Still scream, though his momma say, "never leave the backyard"
Niggas out shooting, used condoms on the playground
Stay 'round crackheads, squatting out vacant flats
Teen girls getting raped, man it's all fact
Hooks swoop up, take your money and your crack
Might get your weed back, put your ass out the back
Starvin', narcs comin' we chalking
Run up, stash the work, get the guns out the closet
Seen niggas in the county get they brains stomped out
While the dep's did nothing they just stood there and watched
Tired of Coney, motor city got me lonely
For security, I got the .40 on me
Crib's rent unpaid, bills in the mailbox
Letter from your cousin on the bloc, man it stay hot
Most niggas I grew up with that are locked up
Are lost to a trap, leader ass stuck
And most souls I know got babies or a lady
Never met a old chick that tell me that she married
It's crazy in a city where there's money to gamble
But lookin' at the scenery, it's all in shambles
I lay back, reminisce on earlier times
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind

[Hook 2x]
When the moon come out, and the sun don't shine
I be on the corner all day continuing the grind
When the sun comes up that just let me know the time
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind

[Verse 2]
At the Cabernet, late night, saturday
Tight fitted, drunk off hennessey, I put the gat away
I'm nervous 'bout it cause these niggas lookin' kinda strange
As I have them very thoughts, niggas got it in the brain
I'm headed for the exit, while I'm slipping on champagne
Kicking bottles on the floor, I'm just trying to hit the door
And everybody else too ain't tryna get trampled
Heard two shots, tripped, and twisted my ankle
And we can never party, a bunch of hatin' niggas
In a city that's corrupted with some grimey-ass bitches
Could be your best friend or even your relative
Snitch on you or put the .40 in your grill
And nigga that ain't right, niggas your whole life
When you get locked won't send you a kite
I lay back, reflect, think of earlier times
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind
 lived my whole life for a green piece of paper
Results of chasin' that
Raiders on respirators
Wanna make a deal?
Gotta talk to ya later
They say I'm immature like babies in incubators
Motherfuckers I'm a don
Hood phenomenon
Game so tight I can serve Farrakhan
A bacon double cheese burger, nigga that's unheard of
Koch that, pop that, you never heard of cause
I'm all about murder
Bloody bloody murder
Pound flipper, bitch getter, four clip inserter
Chase the thunder bread like Urkel did Laura
You get in my way and an oceano snorkel

And I dog these hoes like a Georgetown Hoya
When I get locked you gotta talk to my lawyer
So be cool nigga, sit back, relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"
I just talked to him give him 15 minutes
So please have patience, dawg we gon' get it
So be cool nigga sit back relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"

I'm in the hood all day
Where the fuck are you niggas?
Glennwood stove
A loosie and two swishers
And what you don't know
I'm about to teach ya
For them Ben Franklin's niggas singin' like Aretha
Smokin' sour diesel with this bitch named Keyshia
So much lip gloss she fuckin' up the swisher
I'm a real nigga
And nigga you ain't
You a bitch ass nigga, nigga I ain't
Unforgivable
Nigga you bit the fo'
Give it to a nigga now he bleedin' like menstrual
Cycle, you might grow, shoot like Ivo
Monster and the letter man, Thriller like Michael

And I dog these hoes like a Georgetown Hoya
When I get locked you gotta talk to my lawyer
So be cool nigga, sit back, relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"
I just talked to him give him 15 minutes
So please have patience, dawg we gon' get it
So be cool nigga sit back relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"
rom the hood where them niggas pack fullys
Turn an ounce of reg to a cutty
Count money with a 10 deep flannel on
SB's lookin' like they been painted on
Jeans fittin' like they was made for me
Your pants lookin' like, they was hand-me-downs from your Daddy
Get at me, my fit worth a stacky
I'm in a caddy getting head in the back seat
Rubbin' on her yakki
Then it start rainin', when I start cummin'
So now I'm brainstorming, on how I'm gon' run it
And ya'll like fags, pussy you don't want it
Gosh darn it, got heat like furnace, and I raise it like thermostat
Rollin' that Thundercat kush look like Panthro
Heard you grab your ankles, take it in your manhole
That's so disgusting, I think I just threw up in my mouth
Can somebody pass me a towel?
A wetnap or something? Nigga is you frontin'?
I beat you in your face, now your head like a pumpkin
Jack-O-Lantern, I'm Danny Tanner
Watchin' that white girl, you a dry jheri curl
You worthless piece of shit
Your baby mama begged me to suck my dick
And I ain't gon' let her, she look like Predator
You a gay boy like David Archuleta
Contra, where niggas pierce armor
It's two niggas, two guns, blowin' out your conscience
You see them chrome fourty-fours, in this bitch with thirty men
Ya'll niggas know the code like...

[Hook:]
Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A B A Select Start
Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A B A Select Start

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
Yo, when I write ya'll, I blackout like nightfall
I'm never shitted on like that blight stall, that's quite small
You wouldn't like me when I get gutter, it's the legit cutter
And you ain't sharp enough to split butter
I stack riches, throwin' niggas in black ditches
You wack bitches, while you mixed up like when the track switches
Hand on my nuts like my sac itches
Lookin' like The Mack, hitting 'lac switches
Hiding guns in my Abercrombie
With a dime piece, gettin' more brain than a zombie
Times 3, Ladies Love Cool J
I need a bitch with more class than a school day
I heard a fool say I wasn't in his top 3
Stepped off with a broke arm and a popped knee
See me & Brown is no regular team
We make the whole planet flip like Omega Supreme
Yeah, make 'em hype, yo I murder with this tight flow
You a typo, plus you suck like lypo
I keep bodies hid, fuck a John Gotti bid
Talk money, then we can chop it up like the Karate Kid
But don't think I won't clap and merk 'em
Infrared, beam 'em up, I will Captain Kirk 'em
And turn 'em to a brainless dodo
And break 'em both, legs one and two, like when Kane was solo
I'm snatchin' up his chains and Polo, the flow's fitted
To pose with it in the strangest photo
I'm bumpin' blue genie, if your stacks is too teeny
First you see me, and then you don't like I'm Houdini
Nigga
Tryna get high to forget that I'm broke
Tho it's high tide still gotta stay afloat
Sweater over hoodie used to be my winter coat
Dish detergent liquid when we ran out of soap
Walk in to the store plastic bag filled with bottles
Stolen basic cable on our ol' floor model
Check in the fridge, nothing to eat
Baby mama killing roaches with her bare feet
My nigga hit me off I fucked up the sack
Trip to Coney Island fucking with a hood rat
Now a nigga back, right where I started
Real true livin' definition of an artist
So now a nigga old but ain't shit changed
Hid this morning when the light people came
Now point me to heaven cause this sure is hell
Tell me what's the difference from being in a cell

[Hook: x2]
Mama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner
Daddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner
My brother on the block, tryna catch sales
Sister on the pole, shake her fruit cocktail

[Verse 2:]
I got locked up, I came back home
Takin' county chances, just to keep my phone on
My baby mama trippin', that bitch don't even work
Stress a nigga out, got me payin' child support
I'm flirtin' with the Beam, I got a date with death
38 revolver, got two bullets left
Sometimes I daydream, about puttin' in myself
Runnin' up to heaven, trippin' up the steps
My nigga want a square, only got one left
So I'm a bust it down with you
If I had it dog, I'd blow a pound with you
My nigga understand, that's just how shit goes
That's why we get high, cause we feel so low
And tho we livin' fast, the money comin' slow
Got a lid up on my nigga, cause his time goin slow
Said a pray for him quick, fans gI'm feelin' kinda sick
Shorty cause my last flip got hit with some counterfeit
Whole damn hundred
Must of been desperate
Be out here bein' greedy, so the line I didn't check it
So I'm sittin' in the spot
Countin' on my knot
Pistol on the flo' while I'm sittin' on the couch
Then I heard a knock
I know this bet' not
I was so damn excited I forgot to grab the Glock
Snatched open the do'
Gave my dawg the nod
And pieced his ass up while he was reachin' for that do' nob
Grabbed his head and kneed him in his chin
Put 'em in a headlock, kicked him in the shin
Got him on the ground
Hands on the throat
But guess what the fuck this nigga started reachin' fo'?
Lucky for me my nigga peeped him, changed the moment
Cause at that very point, shit went in slow motion
Picked up the heater
Cocked that bitch back
Squeezed two times saw a real bright flash
"Tat tat"
Then the fiend started screamin'
Ran out the apartment with his right calf leakin'
Then we chase after
Heater still smokin'
Caught him in the alley and let that bitch open
"Tat tat"
He squeezed two mo' at my man
And next thing we heard he gettin' picked up in an ambulance
Next day
Chillin' feelin' proper
We just smokin' some Mustafah
Hash in it, and we ain't even mention it
Around this time playin' 2K1
We were so young and dumb dawg we even kept the gun
And if we got caught dawg we would've got hung
It ain't even a question will I pop off
Hot like the chicken of the grease with some hot sauce
Used to play the block with the Carhartt
For breakfast it was blunts, bout to get a couple Pop Tarts
Used to ride around with the heckler
Lil' nigga on his grind, Ryan Sheckler
Stash in the dresser
So fuck a school lecture
From professors
Like a teacher I test ya
Never smoke regular haze in a swisher
Runnin' through snow like blades in the winter
Now I treat beats like crack on broke mirrors
Slow like a gem star, nothings been delivered
And now you're all high
So you can thank I
Fuckin' with Brown cause I keep a good supply
I know a lot of fiends that say they can't cry
Cause they sniff so much that it dried out their eyes
And that's real shit

I was sellin' crack back when it was Tommy Hilfiger
Used to keep revolvers in the Nautica
Now I just send a text, niggas come through, offin' ya
Niggas blowin' horns at your burial
Choir singin' loud and in stereo
Your spirit's gone aerial
Your family will miss you
When we hit you
Real nigga saw the bitch in you
Different individual, not what you're used to
One Danny Brown equal the whole Juice Crew
Nigga you doo doo
We all can smell it
Chronic I smoke, I bail it then inhale it
Pint of gram brew got a nigga on loose
Shawty got a bubble and she said she comin' through
Bitches on my dick cause a nigga so fly
And I fuck so much when I nut my dick cry
And that's real shit

Only thing I give a bitch? A fucking orgasm
I'll throw you in the river, hands tied tight
Watch your ass drown, feel it in the air tonight
I'm spitting that dope shit, smoking on regulars
Writing 16's like internet child predators
Rocking that 10 deep, but I stay dolo
You wearing polo, who are you, Young Dro?
I'm fifth floor at the Bellagio
Vegas bitches that's resembling Rosario
Dawson, awesome, hit the head, mario
Sorry yo my tongue long, she squirted off the sheets
She gave me that Becky, I gave her that yoshi
The only time you niggas touch keys is Motif
Go and sell a beat, you never sold a rock
Still be sitting on the couch if I was signed to Koch
Could've signed to The Roc, nah I'm signed to the streets
The D is the only thing that's profiting for me
Feeling like big meech, when we're about to cook up
But not the one from BMF dawg, the one from Lynwood
It ain't a nigga I know
Three years straight
3 dollar blows
Good any hood, anywhere I go I'm straight
Nigga hit me with a hundred cause the look on my face
Mama I'm honored to be your son
Could snatch a stack of stamps out and not rip a single one
Used to be in a rush, to finish off my sack
I was so thirsty dawg, sold a pregnant bitch crack
Let her pay me extra, smoke it in the back
Then she came back
Tities on smacking herself on the back
Talking about something crawling on her
Looking like the world's falling on her
And I pushed it
You rub the foots of the bitches I mushed
Funky ass cutlass 3 deep, blowing kush
[?] got her shook
Started reading once the judge threw the fucking book
But the block was off the hook, said fuck class
Off them same pills that had Carlton dancing fast
Young buck, look, now a grown up
Now I pop those same pills, listening to Donuts
I rap like I bet my life because in all actuality, nigga I did
You rap like you used to hit the pipe
Nah nigga that ain't crack, that's crack head shit
Rep that shit, Will tell a bitch
You wouldn't break a brick, you ain't seeing this dick
You trick on the bitch, dawg you ain't rich
Take a bitch to the movies, take her to the crib
You seeing Brown? Nope, never
About to live the title of the greatest rapper ever
When It's Hot
You need another drink
What cha' think
A nigga gonna do
Go outside
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club

[Verse 1:]
I see a lot of hoes
They all on my dick
Bunch of player haters want to front for a bitch
If a bitch want to fuck me
Then let her do her thing
Just step the fuck back and let her give me brains
I'm insane like who'm sayin'
It's like I got two brains
See my shoe game
Hate'm shit's butane
Y'all niggas too lame
My bill game like poon tang
Nine niggas on a track like Wu Tang
Shoot like two God from too lame
Big ving-rang niggas at the door like... like... like... you rang?
No need for ID
Walk straight past security they don't search me
Put three numbers in my phone for RS-VIP

[Hook: x2]
When It's Hot
You need another drink
What cha' think
A nigga gonna do
Go outside
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club

[Verse 2:]
On the block (On the block)
And on the street (On the street)
They keep banging
They keep banging them trees
No seeds in my cigarillo
We be blacker than romillo
Tasting like Sugar Hills
Let me pop another pill
Silver eighteen hundred
Kryptonite (Yep yep yep!)
I'm on it
No not superman you can call it x-clan
Black red and green to see
All my bitches eat pussy like missy
But they look like Chrissy
From Three's Company
Roll another blunt for me
Smoke so much weed like I'm trying to live my memory
Like I'm trying to smoke away my mad thoughts
Blunt gave 'em up, a bit too bad go
She wanna hit it (hit it)
And I do too
I ain't talkin' bout the weed bitch
I'm talking 'bout you!

[Hook: x2]
When It's Hot
You need another drink
What cha' think
A nigga gonna do
Go outside
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club
I sit and drink some tea with grandma
And talk about how much she isn't getting
We just pray, hope the blessings collect
Yesterday I missed the call from my cousin collect
He upstate, I hope I catch him on another day
But I ain't trying to see him, in a fuckin' round with the gay
One look at my granny, I thought for sure sinking
Damn... you know what I'm thinking
Nah... I see you're kinda slow
Cause I ain't serving shit, but this flow
And this beat is like a pack, flow like crack
I'm a do 'em one better, flip this sect
So these bars is fat nickels, got my first sale
Bought the kids popsicles, the game's so fickle
Got me going and my lawyer fair to cop swishers
Narcs pull us over, talking 'bout where's the pistols
And all we tryna do is just get a couple conies
Cause same shit in the crib man, you lucky we're baloney
Lonely inside living in a quarter house
Bunch a niggas pressed like a church lady blouse
Wonder why all these niggas running to the south
But in these 60's niggas came to where?
Wonder why all these motherfuckers running to the south
Cause in the 60's our elders came from there
Yeah...

I sit and drink some tea with grandma
And talk about how much we isn't getting
We just pray, hope the blessings collect
Yesterday got a call from my cousin collect
He upstate, said he straight, niggas locked
Wroten bars for the mixtape
But I'm far from paid, and the bills don't fade
So if you don't play might be locked in the cage
Nah I play the stage, and the hour's never flexible
Been doing this since granny made me eat my vegetables
Threw away my school schedule...
These niggas lack testicles...
Say what they want, don't do what they feel
Sometimes I look at shit like is it really real?
Same question Meth asked in '94
Had the hilfiger bubble coat...
Crushed on tiffany but she wasn't feeling me
Cause she was in the 12th grade sipping on hennessey
Now she a memory of what she once was
Now if you see her you wouldn't touch her with a buzz
Hipster by heart but I can tell you how the streets feel
Everybody thirsty and they looking for a refill
If the gang eat you guns barking at your doggie bag
Get took out for your take out now you carry out
Murder by delivery, married at the paramount
I just coughed up a fair amount
Of niggas might air it out
Judge a book by cover so we never educated
It ain't about racists poor and rich segregated
Just to get the bacon dawg, you gotta go HAM
Use to be lost til I found who I am
But it took the hook to eat the palm on my hands
Locked tryna get real creative with the spam
Locked in a jam cause a nigga serve butter
Just to get a little bread had to keep tomato smothered
All I really wanted was to overdub my vocals
But no one ever thought that I would take it past local
High a'top a totem man somebody shoulda' told 'em
That if money grow on trees being rich is dime a dozen

[Hook:]
So I'm smoking by my lonely
By my goddamn self
I don't need your help homie
Cause don't nobody really know me
Said nobody really know me

[Verse 2:]
See that's going on a limb
And I used to sell trees, and I used to rock Timbs
Radiohead shit, fiends with The Bends
Back when Granny used to tell me "Stay Out of In"
Blaming cold air out, tryna know my whereabouts
Gone for three days and nobody ever heard about
How I got these Jordans, but that ain't too important
When I got a bitch pregnant and I'm stacking for abortion
And all I really wanted was to give myself a portion
Lit up off the Henney got a nigga self absorbing
Smoking on a bogie, no bud style, who can I trust now?
Lady snitch and got the whole block down
Now we gon' eat now, no rebound, when your boxed out
Belly of the beast now
Now you got me feeling trapped and I can't look back
When the roller head is out and the Pabst is made of ash
And I'm going through the trash tryna' find a little treasure
Living for the better tryna get myself together
You're now listening to Araabmuzik

Poppin' pills get 'em brought to my door like Avon
This that silk suede leather
Y'all niggas polyester and rayon
I stay on them Warhols
9.0 and your skull caught
Fuck them hoes that go hard
That ride the dick like a go kart
While I'm stacking up for that Goyard
Y'all niggas playing that broke card
Kush got me up in that solar
Lines gotta nigga face polar
Y'all ain't stuck in that poor part
Y'all niggas never gonna go far
Bitch I'm getting money fucking white hoes with the blonde hair
So nigga don't even go there
Yo ho pussy like coat hair
I'll never hang my coat there
I get head for the smoke fare
Y'all niggas don't deserve air
Yo ho look like wear and tear with hair like Cher
Share and care
Titties all looking like a sack of pears
Y'all niggas still wearing Roca Wear
Balmain jeans about a stack a pair
Yo bitch be like they in there
Watch the kids like daycare
Araab beats like a bag of pills
Danny Brown so that ain't fair
Looking for your bitch like "Who? What? Where?"
Triple that molly on the top front tip
Chillin' in the deep I ain't going nowhere
Ho suck me off then said take care
Off a Drake CD don't go there
Now the ho wanna freak me like it's 94 and I'm JoJo
Told the ho when she meet me on the creep creep no photos
Got a bad bitch and she choke and all she want is these shows
Hit me up the status is kosher
Dome me up watching Colbert
Nigga I'm never sober
Hungover
And that bag
Dipping with my index my pinky up like that
So bitch I'm on some movie shit
No director shit but Spike that
Bought an eigth of them cookies
Two hours I was right back
Flo's in them cups so nigga go and Sprite that
Yo bitch know what's up my nigga go on and light that
I'm slumped against the wall bitches on my box

Red head ho look like Molly Ringwald
Molly Ringwald
Molly Ringwald
Red head ho look like Molly Ringwald
Off that Molly Ringwald
STYLE!
The cheddar breed jealousy...
The cheddar breed jealousy
Especially if that man fucked up

[Verse 1:]
Y'all don't know where I come from, nigga
You don't know what I've been through, hoe
Said I wasted my time, huh?
Look, bitch, I done told you so
I done got on my own shit
I ain't need your help, though
Bitch, I know I did it
You ain't gotta tell me so
I done come a long way, I'm grindin', grindin'
Really, I ain't really have shit
Now your bitch see me shinin', prime-timin'
And she all up on my dick
'Cause she know I'm ballin', ballin'
J. J. Redick comin' off that pit
Shake, take pics, open up her mouth
And my dick is about to go switch
Bitch, it's... Danny Motherfuckin' Brown
And you know I'm in beast mode
So bitch go run them c-notes
She come through naked in a pea coat
'Cause she know she about to deep throat
Rubbin' on her clit, playin' with her pee hole
Lookin' like she playin' Guitar Hero
You niggas ain't in my league, hoe
My flow's so down, my lingo
No nigga, you ain't my amigo
No senor, you no chico
I do not speak no Spanish
So I don't know what that mean, yo
I met this Filipino, and she was jalapeño

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Get up off of your ass, nigga
Worried about my fuck, boy
I don't love that bitch
Hoe just my fuck toy
Got the game in an uproar
Y'all are lames and so boring
Now your bitch got her tits out
Tryna get my laundry - oh boy!
I'm on some other shit
'Cause y'all done got me fucked up
Y'all don't know who y'all fuckin' with
I'm a Linwood nigga 'til I'm dead in the grave
Detroit techno, shootin' off weight
Nigga'd overtake ya back in the day
Don't make me go back to that nigga in the braids
Raised wrong, caged, but a nigga escaped
So bitch-nigga, don't make me take that bait
Niggas in the hood got love for me
No Limits, got Dungarees
So I'm just tryna smoke my weed
Tell me where the hoes at
All up in my cell phone
Nigga you already know that
So I'm a call some hoes up
Tell 'em bring some drink through
We gon' have a party
Called up your man Achbo
So last song, gettin' fucked up
'Cause we ain't worried 'bout it
Smokin' on that Master P
Bitch we 'bout it, 'bout it
My Uncle offa Blow, nodding while he standing up
Minute's been stuck like he picking something up
Rolling up the swisher with the second near my nuts
While I'm puffin on a Lucie, talkin bout the latest truck
And Hi (how) I'm a come up and get one next summer
So next summer won't be talking bout next summer
Yo bitch is a runner, my niggas had fun with her
Did the whole team and heard you put a gun to her
Homie that ain't pimpin, soft hearted for these hoes
I feeds em lots of pills, and put coke up in they nose
Go to thrift stores, drop a buck on t-shirts
Lines in the dressing room then she bought a cheap purse
Straight up out the hut with some suburb hoes
Expensive perfume and some new old clothes
Cuss it ain't high end, ain't gotta be vintage
She buy her own drinks and week supply of spinach

[Verse 2: Daniel Sewell]
Now baby break it down just to build it back up
Copped a couple pounds, then help me bag it up
A pill and a half now a nigga acting up...
Drunk too much, now a nigga throwing up
But that was last night, nigga I'm still drinking
Smoking on the purple got a nigga pupil shrinking
Plotting on a Lincoln, get it with the ink pin
You Fucking with me, my nigga what you thinking
Your bars too immature this is grown man flow
And that's why my bitches grown with some grown man dough
You're fucking with them youngins, on the phone with them hoes
I text a bitch a message now she knockin' at the door
Naw that's the pill man, let me get four
I swear this the last time, I won't do it no more
But said that last week, and now a nigga back
Fuck it, It ain't like a nigga smoking crack
Catch you slippin' with them all white Buffies
Take that like Puffy
I'll Leave a nigga with some shit stains
Leave blood stains all on them wood frames
Catch you slippin' with your feet up
Nigga, fuck that, even beat your bitch up
Catch you walkin' round North Lyn with Ye's on
Run up on her, snatch those, now they gone
I can get 400 for these wire frames
Fresh out the box, no scratches, mayne
Real deal dawg, no fake shit
Transition lens, nigga take shit
Seen a nigga with them old school Mayfairs
Caught a two piece, at the state fair
Seen a nigga at the Coney with some ice in him
Now the doctor tryin' to put some fuckin' life in him
That's how it is in the city of the motor
Where a nigga doin' what he gotta do to get a quarter
Dime, nickle, penny
Automatic, semi
Catch a nigga with' them Cartiers and I'm like "gimme"
That's why we four deep in this Regal
Bangin' rock bottom, dirty Desert Eagle
Finna hit the club, you know what's up
You got some Cartiers, you gettin' fucked up

[Hook:]
And we goin' in the party
And we snatchin' niggas Cartys
I say we goin' in the party
And we snatchin' niggas Cartys
We goin' in the party
And we snatchin' niggas Cartys

[Verse 2:]
I seen a pair of woods, twenty two hundred
I seen a nigga with' em, I told that nigga run it
I leave a nigga dalmatian for them Malmaisons
For them rosewoods, roses where you stood
And I think them wood frames better on me
Sold 'em for six, coulda got a G
You think you real, g? That heater on your ass
Lose your life over Cartier glasses
I'm where you get caved over shades
Wood on your caskets, flower on your graves
You think them wire frames shinin'?
I'll be at the pawn shop before this rhyme end
And I'm 'bout to get cake
Come to find out that this nigga glasses was fake
It's all good, g, it's aight
That's why I'm bout to hit the club tonightThe thoughts all cloudy in the marijuana sky
But it started raining molly
It got me feeling sorry while I'm feeling on myself
Cause I don't know this bitch name
But I'm feeling on my breast
I know it ain't right, but in this state I don't care
A whole week done went past, I don't go no where
Hotel rooms crushing pills and menus
Daughter sending me messages saying "Daddy I miss you"
But in this condition I don't think she need to see me
Ain't slept in four days, and I'm smelling like seaweed
Problems in my past haunt my future and the present
Escaping from reality got me missing my blessings
Sent a couple g's but that make it no better
And now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy trying to get all together
Been stressing so long think depression done settled

[Hook: x2]
It's time for me to clean it up
I came to far to fuck it up like...

[Verse 2:]
Pops left mom when I was only 18
So rightfully that meant I had to be the man of things
And by 28 mom was damn near homeless
And now I'm 31 she 'bout to fucking cop her own shit
Triple beam dreams brought me nothing but nightmares
Thought that I was helping but the system don't fight fair
Cases had me locked up,
Mama always wrote me
Pops my only visit, they the only ones that loved me
That's why I feel bad, popping Givenchy tags
Knowing that this tee could feed my nephew for a week
For material I'm weak, acting like I don't care
I spend it all on clothes, then something is wrong there
I sent my mom some g's, but that makes it no better
Cause now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy trying to get all together
Been stressing so long think depression done settled
Drop a deuce in that soda
Tell your ho to come over
Coming straight out that Motor
Sipping oil never sober
Bring backwoods of that OG, we smoking them back-to-back
Molly looking like sugar, so you know that I'm dipping it
See my jeans by the stack, and my shoes cost 'bout half of that
Let's not talk 'bout the shirt
She can't even pronounce that
Ghetto nigga on high end
My theory is low end
My tribe on a quest, put that money in motion
So bitch, we smoking and drink
Drinking and smoke
My ho got tats on her face
Sell me them cookies from Oakland
But not the kind that you eat, stuff it in Swisher Sweets
And we smoke blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt

[Bridge:]
I don't know what y'all be thinking
Spaced-out, rolling up that stinky
Big big blunts the size of pinkies
Pour one out, we still be leaning
I don't know what y'all be thinking
Smoking, drinking, drinking, smoking
In that order, we slow motion
'Til it's over, never stop

[Hook:]
Smoking and drink
Drinking and smoke
We be smoking and drink
Drinking and smoke [x3]

[Verse 2:]
Gotta get away, to escape, I smoke this kush to the face
Gotta get away, get away, I think I need the brain
Please oh Lord, oh Lord, I need your help again
Took too many pills, and I think I hear my heart beating
Taking over those chances, honey backwoods stuffed with that grammy
My ho blowing on that potter, mixing liquor with them xannies
Stress party, get away, hope that these problems just go away
Right there in my face, I ignore it every day
Check!
I will eat on them pajamas
Bite all on it like piranha
When it comes to that vagina
Baby girl you could be my dinner
Just lean back, and get it
Won't stop licking til you tell me quit
Let me suck on that clit while you follow my head
Baby girl I know you're with it, ball with me
Fall back on that outfit or something
And I love your thighs I can't deny
Work it like Twerk team and I think my dick want to be the sound
Rolling balls til' my dick hard, didn't say heard like a missed call
I don't really look like I'm trying to fuck and I probably won't care about her tomorrow
Dammit ho, what you trying to do "pour a deuce lets get chopped and screwed"
Fools gold, and you know, and Balmain mark down the shit
Smoking on that freeze, nigga
Got a nigga, amnesia nigga
Comatose and I need a dose
Wanna get behind that ass you got
Dipping to that Diplo
Throw it right when they play tonight
Looking right, thinking of dimes and I think I am gon' fuck her tonight
She lookin' ready to go, and fosho ain’t gon stop
With her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall

[Hook]
Pop the pussy on a hand stand Ha-ha-ha-hand stand [x2]
(Shake that ass for a gangsta nigga)
Pop the pussy on a hand stand Ha-ha-ha-hand stand [x2]
(Shake that ass for a hipster nigga)

[Bridge]
Hands on the floor and her feet on the wall
And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall
When her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall
And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall

Let me see what you're working with
Don't stop girl keep twerkin' it
I'm watching you and I'm wondering if you could do that with my dick in it
She throw it back like a fire ball
Hit it up, order like a house call
Want to eat the cat, be from the back, then give that ho a mouthful
Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working
Don't care when we rolling, don't care when they rolling
Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working
Don't care when we rolling, don't feel when we rolling
Pop the pussy on hand stand, record that on my Handycam
That uncut, ludicrous
Feel that monkey I go Orangutan
Eating on an Adderall, wash it down with alcohol

Writing holy mackarel, actual all factual
Out for the capital, matador ya capsules
Hassle the bitch in a castle with the ill grapples
Tackled her asshole, my dick was like a lasso
Fucked her in her mouth she washed it down with Tabasco

[Verse 2:]
You softer than Flanders' son
Don't make me put hands on son
Jump niggas like "Fuck one on one."
Used to be locked up watching One on One
Young Kyla Pratt was looking thick, nigga wanted some
But soon as I got out white bitches by the tons

[Verse 3:]
I fuck bad bitches to Stacy Lattisaw
While you niggas got blue balls like a Avatar
Eating caviar in El Salvador
She running from my dick like it's a bull and she the matador
She a pregnant labrador
Said my metaphors are the highest caliber
[Hook: Danny Brown]
On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Mommy gave me a book of food stamps
Said go get some bread and a pop and come back
Walk out the door first thing I see
A dope fiend standing there looking at me
Standing right there in front of the porch
With a pipe in his hand and the other a torch
I kept on moving ain't worried bout that
But a block later heard "rat-tat-tat-tat"
Next, some niggas from over there shootin'
Dog I ain't blinked just kept it a-movin'
Block later up: What do I find?
A junkie ho, I laughed at her cryin'
Flaggin' up cars, gettin' her bread
Guess what I seen on the way to get bread

[Hook x4: Danny Brown]

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Mommy gave me a book of food stamps
To go get some bread and a pop and come back
Get to the store, first thing I see
An Arab dude just starin' at me
Lookin' at me like I'm bout to steal
But really though dog, you need to go chill
Grabbed what I needed, left out the do'
Two little boys in front of the sto'
Fiends runnin' up, runnin' through alleys
I kept on movin' nobody looked at me
Course some niggas stomped on my head
All because they wanted the bread
I was thinkin' 'bout somethin'
But I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Remember when I was strugglin'
Fucked up on my knuckles
Tryin' to sell some dirt weed
Taxin' off a ten speed
Money wasn't comin'
For sure nigga I kept frontin'

[Hook:]
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
And I kept lickin' on that clit
Till she gave me that shit
I've been fucked up for so long
Swear to God I got a dib
I put my back into it
Servin' bags to them students
Tell 'em I got that fire
On that porch right there by the Buick
I'm just tryin' to get my mind
Go worry nigga 'bout yours
Rollin' up that swisher
Pourin' up a four
Servin' in them hallways
The courtrooms all day
Hoods kicked the door down
Now we in the conay

[Hook:]
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way

[Verse 3: Scrufizzer]
It's the same old shit
Everybody in a manner that's up top
Buck stop,
It's killin' me,
Niggas are makin' really me,
'Cause I never can bottle up and they be filling it with the mideast
Stick it in a manner, the heaviest rhythm bangin' it out
Don't be let my money getting opposite and can do time
Listen up Danny Brown
I been doing this ting
Skipped in, then I come and lyrical assist 'em
WOO
I had my dubs on the step
I never stopped cause I sit in the booth, I'm finna choose
But I'm runnin this actually I'm realer than Scrooge
You ain't so why you act, dummy
You think you bad, well that's funny
I'm try'na get Maybach money
I'm a Mac Miller, stayin ASAP, rookie

I had them dubs on the step
Close my eyes, feel like I'm going down
In an elevator at 90 miles an hour
And all I see is stars and they coming at me sort of like a meteor shower
My forehead's sweaty, my eyelids heavy, feeling like I ain't goin' make it
Cause inside my head's like a firework show in the 4th July in Las Vegas
Said, I'm trippin', I'm slippin', feeling like I just can't move
I done took me a couple more pills
Next thing I know, I'm taking off my shoes
And I'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows
Nodding off, smellin' like rose petals
Zoning out, two-three like the fiend in hell fire and angel wings
I'm conscious to that world, connin science 'bout that world
All these drugs up in me, it's a miracle I ain't mirror Kurt
I'm numb like a mortician, going dumb with Oakland bitches
They say you hella boosie, roll a backwood up with them cookies

[Bridge: x2]
I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma and my brain going on vacation
Kush coma

[Hook:]
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Get high, my niggas, smoke kush
Get fly, my niggas, dope looks
So many numbers in my phone book
I could start a motherfucking phone book
Know all the fly bitches gonna look
Like I'm on something, tell 'em roll something
I'm that one nigga, bumping two pots
Be like three hoes, that's a foursome
Fuck niggas always want to hold something
Young hot nigga done froze on 'em
Went cold on 'em, beat the golds on 'em
And clothes on 'em, see the hoes on 'em?
Only fear God, never sold on Him
Man, I swear to God, put my soul on Him
Life's a bitch, but she chose on him
Should've died in Hell, but I rose on 'em
In big shades, fuck the hypocrites, die
Time let the tats, for the tick, tock
Clocks on the wall, fuck your wristwatch
Pause, let it stop, hope we get by
Bye when I zoom, let it vroom
'Bout a hundred goons with a fume, better let it [?]
A hundred miles an hour on the booth, better let it loose
A hundred by the sour, molly, flower, and they love the shrooms
That's real rap, I'm stating facts
Contradictions, can't take it back
Mommy's stripping, make it clap
In a kush coma, finna take a nap
I'm out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Half asleep with that cotton mouth
Weed grow house on plantation
Nuggets the size of Rakim rings
Got my head looking like a fatality screen
Got my mind drippin'
Gotta get away from all this bullshit in my way
Knowing goddamn well when the high go away
Same shit gon' be still in my way
I'm a slave to the sticky icky
So nigga roll somethin with me
Been smoking blunts since high school
Now look at all the bullshit I been through
Wanna pass out, but we stayin up
Nigga gotta keep one eye open
Cause nigga ain't tryna miss the next turn
Nigga roll up, then we starting smoking
I'm smoking on that ocho, got my mind on that cosmos
Sippin' on that purple, got a nigga in slo-mo
Dipping in that molly, feel like I'm doing 100 on a Harley
Tell your baby mama sorry, that was one night and please don't call me
[Hook x3: Danny Brown]
[Verse 4:]
I spit hard, you hallmark card poets
So many lines, you can bar code it
She like to lick it on the head while she slow stroke it
Ocean in her panties and I'm 'bout to float through it
Rewind this and just smoke to it
You ain't met a nigga like this before
Eat it from the back, suck on ya toes
The way I put my mouth on it that pussy wet feeling [?]
Throw it back to that A-track, one hour to that Baauer
Now she got my dick hard, and I want to fuck her in the shower
Looking ready to go, oh fo' sho' I ain't go soft
Got her hands on floor, and her feet on the wall
