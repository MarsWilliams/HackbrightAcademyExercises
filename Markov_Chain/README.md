Markov_Chain
============

creates pseudo-randomized mashup of two texts, using Markov chains. Example output from Hilda Doolittle's Sea Garden and Lewis Carrol's Game of Logic:
"Branch is white, the green crushed, each leaf is sharp against the lift and furrow of your bound hair. the narcissus has copied the arch of your slight breast: your feet are citron-flowers, your knees, cut from white-ash, your thighs."
